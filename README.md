## Overview

### The challenge

A palindrome is a word or phrase that can be read the same way forwards and backwards, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing. Note: You'll need to remove all non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, spaces and symbols) and turn everything into the same case (lower or upper case) in order to check for palindromes.

All user stories noted on the [project overview page](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/build-a-palindrome-checker-project/build-a-palindrome-checker) must be completed and automated tests (on FCC platform) must pass successfully.
